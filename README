Usercount.pl script for irssi that has been modded (if you could call a few
lines that) to support tracking peak users, tagged with a prefix of m.

Simple example:

    [11:AfterNET/#ludumdare] [Act: 1,2]            [308 nicks (m529 *5 @6 +2 292)]

Blame `#ludumdare` on [AfterNET](irc://irc.afternet.org/) for this feature, as
I wanted to track how many users our network was gaining over these 48 hour
events.
